If this occurs, it can result in overheating of an MR conditional implant.</td><td>Class II</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>The packaging of these affected UHMWPE humeral liners and glenoids are nonconforming as they do not meet the established packaging specification. They were packaged in vacuum bags that did not contain an additional oxygen barrier layer consisting of Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol (EVOH).</td><td>Class II</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Due to a manufacturing defect, users may experience inaccurate pressure monitoring, an interruption in pressure monitoring, or an inability to zero the device due to either a leak within the TranStar Disposable Pressure Transducer or from a defect within the TranStar Disposable Pressure Transducer chip.</td><td>Class II</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Potential for manufacturing defect. Weld crack led to devices failing at the leak check step in manufacturing.</td><td>Class II</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Boston Scientific has received reports indicating the grid mark overlay on the cross-sectional view did not present correctly when an OptiCross 18 Peripheral Imaging Catheter was connected to the AVVIGO+ Multi-Modality Guidance System while in either Live or Record mode. The Boston Scientific investigation determined that, due to a software anomaly, a 9-grid mark overlay is incorrectly displayed during Live mode when AVVIGO+ is connected to an OptiCross 18 Peripheral Imaging Catheter. Note that the correct overlay display for this catheter is the 15-grid mark overlay, which allows for a reference depth setting of 14.9mm for peripheral catheters.

The improperly mated screw may not be readily recognizable by the user since the screw may not correctly lock, may result in delay in surgery or loss of fixation resulting further intervention</td><td>Class II</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>A slight dimensional variation which has the potential for increased difficulty fitting into outer canister.</td><td>Class II</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Due to software issue, there is a potential when a restock label is printed for a medication stored in automated dispensing cabinets, that the incorrect bin for the medication is printed on the label.</td><td>Class II</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>ACS identified that due to an inoperable chart recorder, humidity readings were out-of-specification in one of the controlled environment areas. As a result, ACS is unable to confirm product sterilization assurance requirements were met.</td><td>Class II</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>A potential device interaction between the Shockwave Coronary IVL Catheter and left-sided Impella Pumps during coronary interventions. Currently there is no Abiomed labeling (IFU etc.) content related to this potential interaction, so Abiomed will update the IFU to include information on this potential device interaction.</td><td>Class II</td><td>18</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

Since the defect reduces the battery life overall, it shortens the time between low battery alarms and increases the frequency with which the user must insert a new battery. Further, the defect may also deliver the low battery alarm when there is significantly less time before the battery completely runs out, from the expected up to 10-hour buffer the low alert is supposed to signal, leading to device powering down and stopping insulin delivery unexpectedly. Per the firm, a subset of pumps with the defect showed the low alert alarm was delivered ~2.5 hours before the device shut off, however, patient reports indicate the time could be even shorter. Replacing the battery will not resolve this issue and the short battery life and the truncated low battery alert lead time will continue to occur. Early battery depletion could result in power loss and insulin delivery could be interrupted, resulting in under delivery of insulin potentially leading to hyperglycemia and/or DKA."
